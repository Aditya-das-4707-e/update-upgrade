You can use my code with this command "git clone <github code link>" 
Okey make your task easy. At first you you install this file. Then make sure this file should work with your system. Then you move this file to your local directory use this command "sudo mv update.sh /usr/local/bin/update". Then this file update your local directory. Please check who can read or write your file. I mean root user only change this script. So make sure it. For check this you need one command "ls -l /usr/local/bin". If you see your pc name there for example "-rwxrwxr-x 1 <your pc name> <your pc name> 383 mar 6 13:09 update" then your file is access by any one who use your pc. So you need to change permission to root. Use this command "sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/update". Then you ready to go.
Now you run "update" command on your terminal.
